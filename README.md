# CouncilHouseCompletionInfo

Fun project that I wanted for personal use to track off the plan property occupancy permit and nbn connectivity in yarra ranges council

This is running through github actions, so I can just go to the action tab and look at the script running twice a day to return me an output of:

```
Occupancy Permit Available: False
NBN Connectivity Available: False
```
